# vanillajs-crypto-coin-tracker

The program was orignally created using Svelte. It is based on this tutorial: [Crypto Coin Tracker screenshot](/assets/Crypto_Coin_tracker.jpg). 

The program is quite simple so it is more efficient, in terms of file size, to use Vanilla JS. This repository contains such an app.
