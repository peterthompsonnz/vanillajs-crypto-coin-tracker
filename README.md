# vanillajs-crypto-coin-tracker

The program was orignally created using Svelte and is based on this repository: [Svelte Coin Crypto Tracker](https://github.com/mbrodt/svelte-crypto-tracker). The program is quite simple so it is more efficient, in terms of file size, to use Vanilla JS. 

A screenshot of the finished app is below.
